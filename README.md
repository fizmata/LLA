## Language Learning Assistant project for Computer Programming (LTAT.03.001)

Libraries: wit.ai, Python-sounddevice, tkinter or pysimplegui

Description: The idea is to develop a language learning assistant that helps users practice speaking and listening skills in a foreign language. The application should allow users to record their voice, transcribe the audio using wit.ai, and compare the transcription with a correct answer. Users can track their progress and receive feedback on their pronunciation and fluency.

Goal: I personally use Duolingo for practising new languages, however, Duolingo does not have the option to record your voice and get feedback on your pronunciation. So this might provide value, especially to new language learners aiming to improve their pronunciation.
